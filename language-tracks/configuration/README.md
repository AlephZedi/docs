# Configuration

## Track-level configuration

The configuration for a language track lives in a file named `config.json` in the root of a repository.

This is used by the website as well as a lot of the tooling in order to properly combine all the disparate language track repositories into a coherent experience and curriculum.

## Dependencies

The `config.json` is used by [trackler](https://github.com/exercism/trackler), which is a light wrapper around the entire Exercism curriculum, and [configlet](https://github.com/exercism/configlet), which is the tool that we use to verify the configuration.

## Automated verification of `config.json`

We have [automated linting of the track configuration](configlet.md).
