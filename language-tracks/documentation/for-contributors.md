# Contributing documentation

You probably don't need a whole CONTRIBUTING.md file. Stick with the project README.md until that is getting crowded.

This should contain a link to the [Exercism-wide contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md) and specific information about how to contribute to your language track:

- how to get the project set up locally
- how to run the tests
- any conventions to follow e.g. style guide etc
