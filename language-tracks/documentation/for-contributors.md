# Contributing documentation

You probably don't need a whole CONTRIBUTING.md fileâ€”stick with the project README.md until that is getting crowded.

This should contain a link to the [Exercism-wide contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md) and information about how to contribute:

- how get the project set up locally
- how to run the tests
- any conventions to follow.
