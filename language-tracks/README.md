# Language Tracks

The goal of a language track is to give people a way to achieve a high level of fluency in the programming language, but at a low level of proficiency. Read more about the distinction between fluency and proficiency in the [goals of Exercism][goal-track] document.

Each track should have the following:

* **README.md** - an explanation about how to contribute to the track
* **config.json** - the configuration file that defines the track ([see details][config-json]).
* **docs** containing user-facing documentation for the track ([see details][docs]).
* **exercises** containing all the exercises, each in a separate directory ([see details][exercises]).
* **config** containing files to help generate exercise READMEs and potentially other track-level configuration files ([see details][readmes]).

The starting template for a track can be found in the [request-new-language-track repository](https://github.com/exercism/request-new-language-track).
