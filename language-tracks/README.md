# Language Tracks

A language track on Exercism is meant to bridge the awkward gap between "hello world" and feeling productive. We're aiming for a high degree of fluency in the basic syntax, standard library, and idioms of the language. In other words, a [high degree of fluency at a low level of proficiency](../about/goal-of-exercism.md).

Each track has lots of small exercises, providing many opportunities for practice and lots of small wins. Each exercise consists of a pre-written test suite, simulating Test-Driven Development, and providing a clear definition of "done".

A track lives in its own repository. Working on the exercises themselves should be like working on any project in that programming language. Since it is part of the larger Exercism ecosystem, there are some conventions to follow, and some necessary Exercism-specific configuration.

## Request a new track

If there is a programming language that you love or are curious about, but that we don't yet support on Exercism open an issue in the [exercism/request-new-language-track](https://github.com/exercism/request-new-language-track/issues) repository. We can chat about what it would take to add it.

## Contribute to an existing track

If you want to help improve one of the existing language tracks, take a look at our [guide to getting involved](../contributing-to-language-tracks.md).

## Launch a track

To include a track on the site we need user-facing documentation, some tooling, mentors, and—of course—exercises for people to solve.

If you've requested a track and are ready to get it going, or if you've decided to adopt one of the unmaintained tracks, check out the [launch guide](launch/).

## Maintain a track

Tracks tend to require some ongoing maintenance. We provide support when people ask questions, support new contributors, review pull requests, improve tooling, and add and improve exercises. We've written down some of the tips, tricks, and hard-earned lessons that we've picked up over the past few years in the [track maintainer](../maintaining-a-track/) documentation.
