# Reference Solution

The reference solution is typically named something with `example` or `Example` in the path, but you can define a pattern for the reference solutions in the `config.json`, defined by the `solution_pattern` key.

The solution does not need to be particularly great code as it is only used to verify that the exercise is coherent.

If you change the test suite, then make sure the reference solution is fixed to pass the updated tests.
