# Exercise Versioning

It's only when we get a bunch of people having conversations about the solutions that we really discover what makes a problem interesting, and in what way it can be improved.

Some changes to the test suites will invalidate existing solutions that people have submitted.

We think this is totally fine, however sometimes people start leaving feedback saying _this doesn't pass the tests_. This is technically true, but since the solution passed the tests at the time it was written, it's generally more useful to just discuss the code as it is, rather than enforce strict adherence to the most recent version of the tests.

Some language tracks have implemented a simple, manual versioning system to help avoid unnecessary discussions about failing the current test suites.

If the exercise is versioned, then the test suite will probably have a _book-keeping_ type test at the very bottom that asserts against a value in the reference solution. If the change you're making is backwards-incompatible, then please increment the version in both the test suite and the reference solution.
