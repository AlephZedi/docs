# Managing the Curriculum

The tracks should implement the exercise idiomatically in the language at hand, without veering too far from the problem description in the README.
Keep the [goal of Exercism][goal] when considering new exercises or changes to existing ones.

**Exercises should not enforce a single way to solve the problem, if possible.** The more interesting exercises allow several approaches, and create rich opportunities for discussing trade-offs when people submit their solutions.

Sometimes it's tempting to expand the exercise to cover more cases or a broader topic.

This might be the right thing to do. Or it might add more work with little additional value. The right answer might also be to invent a new exercise to cover the proposed ideas. Consider whether this should be discussed just among the maintainers of a single language track, or whether it should be raised to all track maintainers via an issue in the [problem-specifications][] repository.

Don't be afraid to skip (or 'forego') exercises that don't make sense in the language, or that are not particularly interesting.

For more nitty-gritty details about what to consider concerning exercises, see the document about [reviewing pull requests](/you-can-help/review-pull-requests.md).
