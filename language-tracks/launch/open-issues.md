# Open issues

We've found that it's useful to have about 10 open issues at any time that someone can come in without any context about the project and contribute to.

That might be as part of [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/), or a short-term campaign like [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) or [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/), or just something that you can share on your social network now and then to see if you can pull in new faces.

Label these with "good first patch" and link to this search from your README.

## What to include

Without being familiar with the project, the reader should understand

- what problem the issue is trying to address
- what needs to be done to close the issue
- how to get started

In this case we're adding more exercises so we can launch the new track, we're asking them to submit a pull request that implements the exercise, and we can point to:

- the problem-specification for this exercise
- our [guide to implementing an exercise from specification](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/implement-an-exercise-from-specification.md).
- the track README with details about getting set up to contribute

## Bulk issues

There's a command-line tool, [Hub](http://github.com/github/hub), which makes it easy to prepare a template issue and submit issues in bulk.
You can also access the [GitHub API directly](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#create-an-issue), or by using an API client.
