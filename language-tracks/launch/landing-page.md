# Prepare the track for the site

## Language track icon

In order to design an icon for the site open a new issue in the [exercism/website-icons](https://github.com/exercism/website-icons/issues) repository, answering the following questions:

* Does the language have an official logo? If so
  - please include a link to an example
  - please list the attribution rights of that logo
* Does the language have an unofficial logo? If so
  - please explain the ways in which people use the unofficial logo
  - please include a link to an example
  - please list the attribution rights of that logo

## Introductory copy

Each track has a landing page on the site.
E.g. https://v2.exercism.io/tracks/go

The page is meant to entice people into wanting to try the language out.

There are three things that we need: a short blurb for the header section, an "about" section with a bit more detail, and a code snippet that gives a visual impression of what the language syntax looks like.

For details on each of these see the full [documentation about introductory copy](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/documentation/introductory-copy.md).

## User-facing documentation

We need to guide people through the process of getting their development environment working, and make sure they know how to run the tests.

As a bonus, we could provide some links to learning resources for people who are completely new to the language, and resources that come in handy while they're developing.

More on this in the [documentation about documentation](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/documentation/for-consumers.md).

## Maintainer bios

Write a short bio for yourself, and add it to the [maintainer config](/maintaining-a-track/maintainer-configuration.md).
As you bring on new co-maintainers, have them add themselves to the file as well.
