### I see a problem on the website

* If you're having trouble figuring out how to do something on the website, jump in the [online support chat](https://gitter.im/exercism/support) and ask there.
* Check out [exercism/exercism.io](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)'s repo for bugs; and while we might know there's an issue, any additional details sometimes can help.

### I see a problem with the command-line client \(CLI\)

* If you're having trouble installing or working with the CLI, ask for help in our [online support chat](https://gitter.im/exercism/support).

### I have an idea about making the website better

We're currently working with professional user experience designers on rethinking the entire experience from scratch. Check out the [roadmap](about/roadmap.md) for more details about this.

### I have an idea about improving the command-line client \(CLI\)

Current specific discussions:

* Overall user experience with the CLI: [exercism/discussions\#129](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues/129).

Here are some helpful starter searches in the two repositories that contain ideas about the CLI:

* [exercism/cli](https://github.com/exercism/cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [exercism/discussions?cli](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+cli+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

If the idea isn't being discussed yet, kick it off in the [exercism/cli](https://github.com/exercism/cli/issues/new).

### I have an idea about a brand-new exercise for Exercism

New exercise ideas are definitely welcome! Here's how to ensure the idea lands in the right place:

* Check to see if the exercise is listed: [https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises).
  * If it is there, but not in the language you'd like to solve it in, put in a request in [that particular language's repository](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aexercism+topic%3Aexercism-track).
    * if you have the time and the desire, you can help _even more_ by [implementing it](finding-your-way.md#i-would-like-to-help-i-am-fluent-in--want-to-get-better-at-a-particular-programming-language).
  * If it is not there, suggest it in [exercism/problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/issues/new).
    * if you have the time and the desire, you can help _even more_ by [implementing it](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#implementing-a-completely-new-exercise).
* If you know of a good source of potential new problems, please share: [exercism/problem-specifications\#107](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/issues/107).

### I have an idea about improving an existing exercise

* If the idea is to improve the...
  * **instructions** of the exercise, you can make a difference by making the suggestion in the [exercism/problem-specifications repository](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/issues/new).
    * if you have the time and the desire, you can help _even more_ by [fixing it](language-tracks/exercises/anatomy/readmes.md).
  * **tests** or **starter code** of the exercise, you can help by making the suggestion in the "Issues" section of the [corresponding language repository](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aexercism+topic%3Aexercism-track).
    * if you have the time and the desire, you can help _even more_ by [fixing it](finding-your-way.md#i-would-like-to-help-i-am-fluent-in--want-to-get-better-at-a-particular-programming-language).
