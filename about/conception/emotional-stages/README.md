# The Involvement of Emotion in the User Experience

_by [@nicolechalmers](https://github.com/nicolechalmers)_

**Removing Barriers to Usage**

The aim of this document is to consider the feelings a user might experience over the duration of their relationship with Exercism - from the first touch point to the point where a user feels well embedded into the community and committed to the product. People experience varying levels of discomfort when trying something new and when learning new things. Identifying where our users will be most uncomfortable at this stage in the product design process is an important opportunity for us to remove/reduce any barriers that stop users progressing with Exercism and create an experience that is enjoyable. I’ve drawn out the user journey here: [User Journey](/about/conception/emotional-stages/user-journey.pdf).

I’ve identified 3 main stages in the user journey where users are likely to have some negative feelings.

* Investing in a new online product
* Learning to code
* Receiving feedback

In lots of cases positive feelings (excitement, determination, past enjoyment) will override these negative feelings and users will carry on using the product normally, but in some cases they will result in users deciding not to sign up or dropping out. I’ve given thoughts on how we can reduce these occurrences.

## Investing in a new online product

The stages users move through to sign up to Exercism are:

### 1. Discovery

There are different ways someone might first hear about Exercism i.e. via a Facebook advert or through a face-to-face conversation with a friend. At this stage our potential users will be intrigued and inspired to find out more. There won’t be any instinctive negative feelings around Exercism at this stage - perhaps a little skepticism.

What we can do:

- The most positive first touch point with Exercism will be via a recommendation / word of mouth. We can make sure any recommend a friend incentives, social shares from Exercism etc. are really appealing and informative.
- We can have a clear and memorable tagline so recommenders can instantly explain Exercism in a super-clear way.
- Have good open-graph cards so where-ever Exercism appears in social media it has clear brand explanation.

### 2. Research

Those who have heard about Exercism through word of mouth or via a blog/magazine will feel more instinctively trustful of the product and are likely to do less/no research before signing up.
Others will want to read more about the product - they might visit the Exercism landing page and/or google “Exercism” to see what others are saying about it and how it compares to alternative sites.

**Negative Emotions to mitigate:** skeptical, distrustful, overwhelmed

What we can do:

- Make sure landing page copy encourages trust. With Meducation we found testimonials worked well, affiliation with trusted brands e.g. “Exercism, as featured in Wired” “Sponsored by GitHub”, highlighting any awards won, mention size of community “over X members”, feature any tech influencers who are involved
- Make it clear why we are different from competitor products and who we cater for.
- In all our copy and communication I think we should keep the tone really down to earth, not salesy and make the company/community feel really transparent - I think this is the way to gain trust. This is what has worked really well so far so we should continue with the same tone of voice.
- Emphasis on the fact Exercism is free - nothing to lose and we’re not going to try and get anything from you in the future (e.g. money, commitment)

### 3. Decision to Sign Up

The next step is where the user chooses whether or not to sign up - do they click the button or do they not? Choices are stressful for us because we’re fearful of making the wrong decision or that our choices will mean change.

**Negative Emotions to mitigate:** fear, wariness, hesitant

What we can do:

- We need to make the landing page, blog posts etc. sound and feel exciting, like an opportunity not to be missed - this should overpower any doubts people have about signing up.
- Encourage desire to learn through Exercism through blog posts. Write posts around the method of learning, the thought (and science) that’s gone into designing the tracks and the product. If we can excite potential users in this way before they even hit the landing page, they will be less hesitant to sign up as they will be more informed about the product and what they can expect to gain from it.
- Be clear and transparent about next steps and how long they will take - “we’ll ask you a few details”, “you’ll choose a language track”, “you can start learning” etc.
- Clear and detailed FAQs so people know what they’re getting themselves into - “can I remain anonymous”, “how long does a track take” etc. If people still have questions make it easy for them to contact us.
- Consistent and clear call to actions on each page.

### 4. Parting with Personal Details

The user has decided to give it a go but will be very wary of giving away personal details, email address, GitHub profile etc. This is a key place to enforce trust and enforce the user’s decision to sign up.

Although Exercism is free, we shouldn’t underestimate what it takes for someone to hand over their email address. Email addresses are like a new currency, people need to understand what they’re getting in return for their investment, just like they are parting with money.

**Negative Emotions to mitigate:** fear, worry, reluctance, fight or flight

What we can do:

- We shouldn’t ask too much at once, we can ask skills based questions later so as not to overwhelm the user at this point
- Have a side bar of Common Questions e.g. Can I be anonymous?
- Reiterate the benefits of Exercism
- Show more testimonials to reinforce user’s decision and encourage them to continue

### 5. Final Commitment

At this point the user has invested quite a lot into the website so probably won’t still be in decision making mode. This is a good time to positively reinforce their decision to sign up and get the user excited about what’s to come.

**Negative Emotions to mitigate:** regret, confusion

What we can do:

- Make this last step really easy and manage expectations about what’s coming next.
- Nice welcoming design will help user feel like they made a good decision and they’re in a safe space.
- Emphasis that they’ve joined X other people and that this decision will pay dividends for years to come.

## Learning to code

People need to experience a certain level of discomfort in order to learn. Everyone will have a different tolerance to discomfort and a different level of necessary discomfort to learn. For Exercism, we need to decide how much discomfort we want users to feel at different points e.g. do tracks include a combination of deep, hard exercises and easy exercises that go over what user has already learnt (to give them a boost) or do we make it clear that the exercises are hard so those who sign up need to have the patience and determination to push through. Much of this is about expectation management. I’m sure Katrina will have lots of thoughts on this and would’ve applied lots of her knowledge to the tracks already, so it would be great to understand all of that to make sure we’re aligned to existing learnings.

**Negative Emotions to mitigate:** frustration, disappointment, confusion, isolation

What we can do:

- Have encouraging and motivating copy surrounding exercise content.
- To manage expectations, make it clear when users are about to come across something difficult e.g. “You’ll probably find X difficult because we haven’t covered Y yet. This is totally fine just do your best and we’ll fill in the gaps later” - the book I’m using to learn Python is very much like this and it makes me feel really calm and comforted.
- Get users to choose how difficult they found each exercise at the end and why (like Freeletics App). We could use this data later on to determine which exercise users might do next or provide recommended reading.
- Highlight idioms and concepts in the exercise description so users can easily refresh their memories on things they’ve forgotten. This will rely on us having a bank of explanations, forum threads or links to other sites.
- Constantly showing personal progression and success to encourage people that they have already achieved things.
- Reminding people what they’ll achieve if they continue the whole track, and the level of expertise they can achieve. Think about “How you could use this in the real world?”
- Exciting facts around the site (Did you know that the last mission to Mars used this thing in Java). Make you realise that the small things are powerful, e.g. a loop feels stupidly basic, but a well optimised loop can make the difference between success and failure in a spacestation context.

## Receiving feedback (e.g. code reviews)

![](/about/conception/emotional-stages/feelings-code-review.png)

Our survey and Twitter poll have informed us that overall people welcome code reviews but much prefer those that have been delivered well. When code reviews are delivered badly they can generate lots of negative emotions and could turn users away from the product.

**Negative Emotions to mitigate:** uncomfortable, irritated, frustrated, deflated, demotivated, defensive, condescended, conflict-adverse.

What we can do:

- Treat every piece of feedback as an opportunity to make users love Exercism a bit more. Not many online products get the opportunity to interact with their users in this way - we shouldn't underestimate the value of it.
- Create lots of blog and video content highlighting how to give great code reviews.
- Create blog posts and share research around how best to receive feedback e.g. http://coachingleaders.co.uk/the-emotionally-intelligent-way-to-receive-feedback/.
- Provide training (via a track) on how to give good feedback. Show examples of bad feedback and explain why they’re bad. Make sure the guidance on giving feedback is aligned with our core values and the culture we want to develop e.g. do we want feedback to be quite light hearted and jokey or do we want to focus on simplicity even if this means the feedback has less personality?
- Give users the ability to flag up bad feedback.
- Choose mentors with credibility/experience.
- Ask people how they found the feedback after they complete an exercise. Encourage them to actively engage in the process.
