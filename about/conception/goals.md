# Goals, Hopes, and Dreams

People might use Exercism for any number of reasons. Some reasons are things people have shared explicitly, other reasons we've devined from interacting with Exercism users over the course of several years.

We've grouped the goals into two categoriesâ€”those that we think fit with Exercism, and those that we consider out of scope for the product. We assign no judgement to people's goals. We do not think the goals in the latter category are less valid than the goals in the former, only that Exercism cannot fulfill all needs for all people.

Understanding [what Exercism is and what it is not](https://github.com/evazorro/docs/tree/2c664e0dbfe63365d694d7520f5303ec36c908a0/about/goals-of-exercism.md) will enable us to make it the best product possible.

For people who come to Exercism looking for the out of scope goals we will endeavour to point them to other websites, projects, or resources that might better suit their needs.

### In scope

* Learn a language
* Get better at a language
* Gain fluency in a language
* Be able to join a language community
* Get feedback on their programming style in a language
* Enjoy programming in a language \(fun / therapy / escapism\)

### Out of scope

* Get a job in X
* Learn how to do X in a language
* Learn common libraries in a language
* Write a project \(that is not possible in their current languages\) but is typically done in X
* Contribute to an OSS project in X
* Gain the ability to teach others

While using Exercism might help people achieve these goals, we are not going to design the product to explicitly support these outcomes.

## Emotional Success

It is important that people feel like they're developing throughout the process of using Exercism, and that at the end of a track there should be a sense of completion and satisfaction/empowerment.

We believe the key emotions are:

* **Confident**: the confidence to do something with their new skill, be it teach, learn more, contribute, or showcase their new skill by adding the language to their bio. They should feel like they could do a lightning talk at a meetup about something they learned. They should be able to pair with someone in a language. While Exercism doesn't necessarily give you the skills to teach or contribute to open source, completing a track in Exercism should make you feel confident that you can do those things.
* **Comfortable/Empowered**: able to tackle all the resources that exist on the internet for diving into the depths of a language.
* **Satisfied/Proud**: a sense of accomplishment at having completed something.
* **Excited**: having completed a language track on Exercism people are poised at the door of many new opportunities.

It's also possible and perfectly reasonable to assume that people might feel nothing in particular, other than that they're done, and that they're moving on \(pragmatism\).

Supporting a sense of complection, satisfaction and empowerment ties into our exploration of [expectancies of success](./#expectancies-of-success).
